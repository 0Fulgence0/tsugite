# Tsugite: Interactive Design and Fabrication of Wood Joints

This is the repository related to a paper presented at UIST 2020.
It is an interface where you can model a joint geometry in a voxelized design space, and export milling paths for fabrication with a 3-axis CNC-machine.

The system performs geometric evaluations in real time and provides graphical feedback accordingly (see image below).
