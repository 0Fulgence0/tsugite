# Tsugite
## Interactive Design and Fabrication of Wood Joints

![](img/tsugite_title.png)

This is the repository related to a paper presented at UIST 2020.
It is an interface where you can model a joint geometry in a voxelized design space, and export milling paths for fabrication with a 3-axis CNC-machine.

The system performs geometric evaluations in real time and provides graphical feedback accordingly (see a-h below).
